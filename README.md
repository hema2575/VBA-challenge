# VBA-challenge
This is my first attempt on the Week-2 VBA HW. This code does the following in the order described. 
 (a) Compares rows to find uniquestock tickers
 (b) Determines annualopen, annualclose stock prices and writes them into separate rows
 (c) Calculates total stock volume at the same as step(b)
 (d) Needs user intervention (button clicks) to calculate yearly change, percent change and colorcode
