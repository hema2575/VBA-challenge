# VBA-challenge
This code does the following in the order described. 
 (a) 'stk_data_Solved.VBA' has the solution code.  Upon executing, it starts with a Msgbox to tell the sheet name. 
      I have added another version namely 'stk_data_withoutmsgbox_Solved.VBA' to run all at once without any msgbox.
 (b) The code compares rows to find unique stock tickers, determines annualopen, annualclose stock prices, Calculates total stock volumes, calculates yearly change and 
     percent change within a 'For loop' with 'conditionals'. IT also colorcodes the 'yearly change' as it calculates. 
 (c) All values are written in the same sheet (as shown in the HW instructions)
 (d) The code calculates Greatest Stock Volume total, Greatest % increase, Greatest % decrease and write to the same sheet in a separate column.
